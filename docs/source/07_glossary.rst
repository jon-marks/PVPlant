   **AC**
   **AC Electricity**
   **Alternating Current**
   **Alternating Current Electricity**
      Electricity (current and voltage) that oscillates, like that supplied by the municipality or 
      Electricity Supplier (like Eskom in South Africa). It is a flow of electrical charge 
      (electrons) that periodically changes direction.  The frequency of alternation is typically 50
      or 60Hz.
   
   **Atmospheric Turbidity***
      See :term:`Turbidity`
      
   **Battery**
      A device that stores electrical charge (electrons).  A battery is said to be charging when it
      is accepting electrons - current that flows into the battery.  A battery is discharging when
      it releases electrons - current flowing away from the battery.

   **Break-Even Date**
      The projected future date at which all :term:`CapEx` and :term:`OpEx` PV Plant costs are 
      paid back with Grid Energy Supply savings having supplemented :term:`Load Demand` with 
      :term:`Solar Power`.
      
   **CapEx**

   **DC**
   **DC Electricity**
   **Direct Current**
   **Direct Current Electricity**
      Electricity (current and voltage) that does not oscillate, like that from a :term:`Battery`, 
      or a :term:`Solar Panel`.  It is a one directional flow of electrical charge (electrons) in a 
      conductor (copper or aluminium wire).
      
   **EMS**
   **Energy Management System**
      Coordinates in real time, the supply of energy from the various energy sources in a 
      :term:`PV Plant`, deciding how much of each is needed, and shares the energy between supplying
      the :term:`Load`, and charging the :term:`ESS` batteries.
      
   **ESS**
   **Energy Storage System**
      That component of at :term:`PV Plant` used for storing energy to cover outages and reduce
      peak demand from the :term:`Grid` 

   **Genset**
   **Generator**
      Typically an electricity generator powered by fossil fuels.
      
   **Grid**
      An electrical network supplying power.  Without any defining context refers to the main supply
      grid for the premises.
       
   **Insolation**
      The radiant energy from the sun over a period of time.
      
   **Internal Grid**
      Without any defining context refers to :term:`Photovoltaic Plant Internal Grid`
      
   **IRR**
   **Internal Rate of Return**
      Is the :term:`ROI` of initial investment at its :term:`Break-Even Date`  It often makes sense
      to use :term:`NPV` numbers or inflation adjusted NPV numbers in these calculations.    

   **Inverter**
      A device that takes AC or DC electrical energy and converts it to AC or DC of another form.
      When referred to as a a component of a PV Plant:  A device that converts DC electical energy
      provided by PV Panels and efficiently transforms it into energy compatible with the PV Plant's
      :term:`Internal Grid`.  Otherwise, in general terms, it is a devices that converts 
      :term:`AC` or :term:`DC` electrical energy from one form to another form. 

   **Irradiance** 
      The instantaneous radiant power from the sun.
      
   **LCOE**
   **Levelised Cost of Energy**
   **Levelized Cost of Energy**
      Is the ratio of the total costs (both :term:`CapEx` and :term:`OpEx`) over a period starting 
      with the initial investment in the PV Plant, over the total energy produced in that period.
      It often makes sense to use :term:`NPV` numbers or inflation adjusted NPV numbers in these 
      calculations.  The period can range from one year to the lifetime of the investment, typically
      25 years or more.

   **Load**
      That which is requiring electrical energy to operate.   
      
   **Load Demand**
   **Load Energy**
      The amount of electrical energy required to operate the :term:`Load`

   **Local Grid**
      The electrical network that supplies the :term:`Load`
      
   **Modules**
      Without any defining context, refers to :term:`Photovoltaic Panel`
   
   **NPV**
   **Net Present Value**
      Is the present value of of future amounts.  For example, how much would R100 received in one
      year's time be worth to me now when interest rates are 10%.  The answer is R90.91, which is: 
      
      .. math:: NPV = \frac{future\ value}{(1\ +\ interest\ rate)}
         :label: NPV

   **O & M Costs**
   **OpEx**
   **Operating Expenditure**
      The costs associated with operating and maintaining an asset such as a PV Plant.  It is an

      The name-plate capacities of the modules and or inverter of a PV Plant.  A PV plant with
      100 -- 500Wp modules is said to have a 50kWp capacity.  A PV plant with 4 -- 100 kW Inverters
      is said to have a 40kW capacity.

   **Photovoltaic Grid**
   **Photovoltaic Internal Grid**
   **Photovoltaic Plant Internal Grid**

   **Photovoltaic System**
      An Electrical Energy System that harvests energy from the Sun to produce electricity.

   **ROI**
   **Return on Investment**
      A financial management ratio of the return over the investment amount in a fiscal period 
      starting with making the investment.
      this case the return is the savings by supplementing load demand with solar power, less the 
      :term:`O & M Costs` in that fiscal period.The fiscal period is anywhere from a year to the 
      anticipated lifetime of 25 years or more.  It often makes sense to calculate the net present
      value or net present value inflation adjusted values to use in ROI calculations.
