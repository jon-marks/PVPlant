.. topic:: You are what you eat!

   "You are what you eat".  Like food gets digested by our bodies to provide us nutrition, input 
   data gets processed by PV Plant modelling software to provide power production estimates.  
   No matter how sound the processing model (digestive system), the results produced are only as
   good as the data (food) provided.
