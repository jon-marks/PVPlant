Introduction

Purpose
=======

Decisions to commit to a PV Solar Plant are largely financially driven.  Even if there are 
'green' and renewable energy motives, I am not aware of any PV Solar Plants built 'at any cost'.  

:term:`PV Plant Capacity` is a significant consideration in any PV Plant decision.  The PV 
Solar Plant capacity should be comparable in relation to the required :term:`Load Demand`.  There is
often little benefit in proposing a too big or too small system, even if the outlay price appears 
attractive.

Furthermore, there are many technical tradeoffs with short and long term financial impacts that
may be considered in deciding on the parameters of a system to build.


Given a PV Plant proposal, this project aims to provide a tool that accurately models the 
energy output over time.  Then with capex and opex costs of the PV Plant, its viability is 
evaluated.  Multiple PV Plant options can be considered and compared to settle on a proposed PV
Plant that best meets requirements.


Scope
=====

This tool only models the performance of proposed PV Plants, and calculates the financial 
management numbers to determine the plant's fiscal viabilty.  This tool does not involve itself in
the design and selection of components for a PV Plant.  However, having selected components and 
designed a plant, this tool accurately calculates the power production running the numbers against 
:term:`CapEx` and :term:`OpEx` costs, to produce financial management information.  
:term:`Break-Even Date`\s, :term:`Cashflow`\s, :term:`ROI`\s, :term:`IRR`\s and :term:`LCOE`\s are 
useful in determining the viability of a PV Plant or iterative analysing proposals that have been 
fine-tuned to settle on a PV plant with optimal returns.
